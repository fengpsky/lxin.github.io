### 9 topics, some were shared with everybody, some will be.

1. linux kernel tunnel vxlan&gre

2. linux kernel ipsec ikev2&xfrm

3. linux kernel iptables match&target

4. linux kernel neiflter conntrack&nat

5. linux kernel firewall nftables

6. linux kernel traffic control

7. linux kernel locks&interrupt

8. linux kernel cgroup&namespace

9. linux kernel debug&tools


### 3 points I need to improve:

1. net sctp/tcp is complex to me

2. mm is hard for me; vfs, drives, schedule is ok.

3. freebsd need to be paid attention to
